# LEARN TO CODE USING CHATGPT
This repo contains all the exercises done during the course **LEARN TO CODE USING CHATGPT** done on *Quantic*.\
\
ChatGPT can be a tool of astronomical assistance for programmers - with the right prompt.\
\
Programmers can be at times frustrated with the coding-related responses generated by ChatGPT and use up valuable time in debugging and integrating the generated code. Well, this can be circumvented by employing a structured approach to prompting ChatGPT for coding assistance and debugging.\
\
LEARN TO CODE USING CHATGPT - Unlock the synergy between coding and natural language by prompting ChatGPT to create working programs for you. Master prompting techniques and coding basics as you optimize code evaluation, testing, and refactoring with ChatGPT's guidance.\

### LEAST-TO-MOST STRATEGY
*Building program from simpler to complex incrementally*
1. ChatGPT could introduce new error in the previous working code\
&emsp;Must take step-by-steo verification of the code. *VERSION CONTROL WILL HELP A LOT*
2. MORE THOUGHT IS REQUIRED BY THE PROGRAMMER\  
&emsp;Promrammer is to use his intelligence for breaking down and integrating the modules
3. Overall time taken is more.
