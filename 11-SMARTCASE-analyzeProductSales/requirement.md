## YOU ARE 
A warehouse manager AT Mckenzie Megamart. 
### WHAT YOU DO
Keeps shelves stocked across all stores. Analysis a ton of data, 
#### Technical Task
i.e. weekly, each store sends you a spreadsheet with sales of all products; and you have to find if any product fluctuated from more than 10% of the average sales across all stores.   

## HOW TO DO IT
### 1\. 1ST PART
Read data from spreadsheets. 

> I have a directory named Sales with multiple excel files. Each file has two columns, the first is the name of product and has the header **Product** and the second is the number of that product sold and has the header **Sold**.

Now we want to incorporate units testing as we build the app. 

> Write a function that reads in that data for further analysis. 

We also want to add a constraint. 

> The data from each file needs to be separate. 

It is the complete prompt.

I have a directory named sales with multiple Excel files. Each file has two columns. The first is the name of a product and has the header Product, and the second is the number of that product sold and has the header Sold. Write a function that reads in that data for further analysis. The data from each file needs to be separate.

### 2\. Now we also want to test the function. 
> Design test cases and a program to unit test the read_sales_data function.
